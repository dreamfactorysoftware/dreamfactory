## This is an crudely drawn example of the main nginx.conf file. It is the
## distribution version but has been trimmed of things not being used, or
## unhelpful comments.
##
## There is no need for you to use this file as your configuration. Just
## be sure that the conf.d/, site, and locations files are copied to the
## appropriate place in /etc/nginx (or wherever).
##
## Obviously feel free to change whatever you need to match your setup.
